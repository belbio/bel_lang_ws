## activity

`activity(<abundance>)` or `act(<abundance)` is used to specify events resulting from the molecular activity of an abundance. The `activity()` function provides distinct terms that enable differentiation of the increase or decrease of the molecular activity of a protein from changes in the abundance of the protein. `activity()` can be applied to a protein, complex, or RNA abundance term, and modified with a http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BLVD/Process+Modifier+Function#ProcessModifierFunction-ma()[molecularActivity()] argument to indicate a specific type of molecular activity.



### Examples


    act(p(HGNC:AKT1))
