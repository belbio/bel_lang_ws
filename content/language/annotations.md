Each BEL Statement can optionally be annotated to express knowledge about the statement itself. Some important uses of annotations are to specify information about the:

*   biological system in which the observation represented by the statement was made
*   experimental methods used to demonstrate the observation
*   knowledge source on which the statement is based, such as the citation and specific text supporting the statement

Examples of annotations that could be associated with a BEL Statement are the:

*   PubMed ID specifying the publication in which the observation was reported,
*   Species, tissue, and cellular location in which the observations were made, and
*   Dosage, exposure and recovery time associated with the observation.
