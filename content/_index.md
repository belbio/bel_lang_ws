# Official documentation for BEL

The BEL Specifications documented here are created and approved by the [BEL Language Committee](https://github.com/belbio/bep/blob/master/CommitteeGuidelines.md). Any recommendations to update the BEL language or dependent best practices should be added as a [BEP (BEL enhancement proposal)](https://github.com/belbio/bep).

Please use the navigation menu to the left to find out more about the BEL Language. To get started, we would suggest reading in the following order:

1. [Language Structure](language/structure/)
2. [BEL Assertions](language/assertions)
3. [Namespaces](language/namespaces)
4. [Annotations](language/annotations)
5. [References](language/reference)


## TODO

* Add more examples for BEL functions and relations
* Spend a LOT of time adding to the Tutorials section and Getting Started section


## Contributing
This is an open-standard and open-source based effort. If you are interested in participating, please contact *support@bel.bio* or jump into the [Discussion forum](https://forum.bel.bio) for guidance on where to get started. We'd love to have you join us in making biology more reusable, shareable and computable.
